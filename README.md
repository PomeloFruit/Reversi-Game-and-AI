# Reversi-Game-and-AI
Created a fully functional Reversi Game and a computer opponent to play against using C

The first version of the Reversi game has no AI opponent; however will display all the available moves that each player has each turn. 

The second version of the Reversi game contains the AI opponent. The AI is based on Minmax theory, advanced Reversi game theory and a weighted board. Based on the situation and the predetermined weighting of each tile on the board, the AI will choose the move that will generate the most points at that moment in time.
